<p>My name is Leland. I am a professional programmer with a Ph.D. in computational mathematics. This site is a combination of blog, project documentation, and extended resume. I am interested in web technology, algorithm research and development, and open source efforts. Take some time to brows my <a href="/projects">projects</a> and perhaps wander over to my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leland-jefferis-49929189">LinkedIn</a>. Also feel free to shoot me an <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email</a>. I am always interested to hear from you.</li>
