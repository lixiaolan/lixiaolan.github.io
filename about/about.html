<p>My name is Leland. I am a professional programmer with a Ph.D. in computational mathematics. This site is a combination of a blog, resume, and project archive. Depending on who you are, let me point you to something relevant:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Potential employers - Brows my <a href="/projects">projects</a> and perhaps wander over to my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leland-jefferis-49929189">LinkedIn</a>. I am always interested to hear from you.</li>
  <li>Friend or acquaintance - You  must be really bored or maybe I was babbling about a <a href="/projects">project</a> your interested in? Or maybe you are curious to read some of my blog posts.</li>
  <li>Random internet surfer - Greetings stranger. You know better than I what you want. Start clicking at random.</li>
  <li>An automated script - Greetings computer. Here is a meaningless <a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/">link</a> and a fictitious.email@ToConfuse.you.</li>
  <li>Me - Stop being self indulgent!</li>
</ul>
