<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is a framework for generating static websites. Having built websites (and web servers) from scratch, I have an appreciation for its simplicity. One particular convenience is that github supports Jekyll with its public hosting with no setup fuss. Simply create a Jekyll project within your username.github.io project and push it to github... and that's it. Hosting a Jekyll site locally is also effortless allowing easy testing of changes to your site before pushing them.</p>

<p>Racking my brain for disadvantages is quite a task. With any tool, it is meant for a specific purpose. In the case of Jekyll, it's is designed for creating static content blogs. It performs this task briliantly but still allows the user to add as much custom logic as they like. I suspect the limitations of Jekyll would reveal themselves if one attempts to create a decidedly non-blog site, but I have no intention of doing this. I'll write more posts about Jekyll as I discover new features, but for now, my overall impression is: "Ahhhhhh, so relaxing!".</p>
