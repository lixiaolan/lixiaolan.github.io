<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is a framework for generating static websites. Having built websites (and web servers) from scratch, I have a strong appreciation for how painless it has been to use. One particular convenience is that github supports Jekyll web sites in its public hosting with no setup fuss. Simply create a Jekyll project in your public hosting project and push it to github... and that's it. Hosing a Jekyll site locally is also extremely simple which allows for easy testing of changes to your site.</p>

<p>Racking my brain for disadvantages of Jekyll is quite a task. With any tool, it is meant for a specific purpose. In the case of Jekyll its is designed for creating static content blogs. It performs this task extremely well but still allows the user to add as much additional JavaScript logic as they like. I suspect the limitations of Jekyll will reveal themselves if one attempts to create a decidedly non-blog like site using Jekyll, but I have not attempted to wander far from the intended use. I'll write more posts about Jekyll as I discover new features, but for now, my overall impression is: "Ahhhhhh, this is so relaxing and simple".</p>
