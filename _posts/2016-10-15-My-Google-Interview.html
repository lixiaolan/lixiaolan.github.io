<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
<p>If you are here in the hopes of unearthing some inside knowledge about Google's interview process, please continue your search. This post is a rumination on Google's interview process and standardized tests in general.</p>

<h1>Backstory + Thoughs on Standardized Testing</h1>

<p>Several years ago while still a Ph.D. candidate in UW - Madison's Mathematics department, I decided I should try out a software internship. I (stupidly) applied to exactly one: Google's. My crudely crafted resume somehow attracted the attention of a recruiter who happily set me up with a phone interview. I was elated but then reality intruded. The interview went about as well as it could have; namely I failed with flying colors. I thought I knew something about "conventional" programming because I was studying computational mathematics and had written a lot of code in MATLAB. "Linked List? Binary Search Tree? Quicksort? I don't know what those things are, but I can sure as hell provide you several options for simulating non-linear hyperbolic PDE and implement them elegantly. Surly that's enough, right?" were my thoughts at the time. How silly I was.</p>

<p>I found out that day that Google expects all of its engineers to know "CS fundamentals". Having a Ph.D. in computational math is great, but the fundamentals still matter. As someone who made their living for 5 years primarily as a teacher (while in grad school), I do have some perspective on testing and standardized testing. It seems very popular to say something to the effect of: "Standardizes tests don't really test my true abilities. The subjects tested are not necessary for success. They are not fair...". If these assertions were completely true, why are standardized tests used? I remember asking a professor at my undergraduate alma mater (Seattle University) this exact question. She shrugged and said "I agree that they are strange, but studies have shown that good performance on the GRE is strongly correlated with success in graduate school." I never even bothered to follow up to verify the existence of those studies, but I did do some thinking about this statement as I progressed through graduate school... and I realized something. Success in graduate school (and in many things) is derived from the ability to take some arbitrary, complicated pile of material and, with dedication and perseverance (and coffee), comprehend and subsequently master it. The ability to do just that is what standardized tests are primarily testing. The content of the tests is actually not terribly important. However, if one has to choose the content, why not choose it in such a way as to regularize the language spoken by those who pass? This is perhaps a secondary goal of standardized tests: to provide a common vocabulary. I believe it is important for a group of people who will be working together to have a common technical vocabulary. Think of the analogy with spoken language. What if you hired 10 people who are experts at their own language but have not common tongue? Now get them to work together to build something... actually that might be a good premise for a reality TV show.</p>

<p>So what's my point? Google's interview process is about mastering a well defined but sufficiently challenging body of knowledge so as to test the ability of candidates to master it. The content is only important to the effect that it provides some common vocabulary among future employees. So "yes" their interview does not accurately asses your prowess as a coder, but it might help assess you as a researcher.</p>

<h1>Once More With Feeling</h1>

<p>Many years later, and with the proper preparation, I again interviewed at Google. The process was both stressful and enjoyable (two things I don't necessarily find to conflict). I really liked the people I interacted with during the interviews which was the primary factor in my accepting an offer there. Here is an outline of my interview process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Filled out LinkedIn profile: Was subsequently contacted by recruiter.</li>
  <li>Initial call with recruiter: Was asked basic questions. I gave basic answers.</li>
  <li>1st and only phone screen: Was asked more detailed questions. I gave more detailed answers.</li>
  <li>On-site: Ran a gauntlet of 5 consecutive interviews.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>The interview bar may seem high, but if you are thinking about applying, here are a couple things to keep in mind:</p>

<ol>
  <li>No matter your background, make sure you know your fundamentals well.</li>
  <li>Knowing your fundamentals is mostly about proper, organized preparation (as apposed to innate ability or predestination).</li>
  <li>There is some luck involved (mostly to do with who you get as an interviewer) but preparation mitigates this.</li>
  <li>You can always try again (as I did).</li>
</ol>
