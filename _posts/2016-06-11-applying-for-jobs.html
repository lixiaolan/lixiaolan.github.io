<p>Applying to jobs; a process which seems to require a skill set quite unlike that which is needed to perform the job itself. Writing a resume which is succinct, eye catching, yet substantial is a balancing act and a unique writing challenge perhaps best suited to someone working in advertisement. Interviews fall somewhere between a conversation and a bi-directional interrogation perhaps best suited to the sales person. And for programming work, there is the technical interview which is like trying to teach a class of students a subject that you yourself don't necessarily know. In short, job hunting is a different mode that we must occasionally switch to and then, upon finding a new job, immediately switch out of.</p>

<p>I have come to think of job hunting more from the angle of "at which company would I would fit best?" instead of "what offers can I get?". The reason is simply that the former provides a larger filter than the latter. But knowing at which company you fit best is a very subjective and also requires some insight into the culture of the company. Assuming you don't have an acquaintance at a prospective company, how is one to make an informed choice? In trying to answer this question, I came across <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2016/03/07/ten-unmistakable-signs-of-a-bad-place-to-work/#554846c97fad">an article in Forbes</a>. The title reads "Ten Unmistakable Signs Of A Bad Place To Work" which is decidedly negative. Though the author is somewhat dramatic and flippant (in my opinion), it none-the-less provides some useful criteria. In the interest remaining positive, I chose to read this as "Ten Unmistakable Signs Of A Potentially Good Place To Work" and invert each "sign". Based on my past observations, here are a few that stuck out to me:</p>

<ol>
<li>Moonlighting is not Mentioned: An employees life outside of work is not the business of a company. This assumes, of course, the employee is not working directly against the interests of the company (of course). But if one wishes to join a band and do gigs on the side, this is acceptable as long as they meet expectations at work.</li>
<li>Reference are Allowed: It is good advice (I believe) to earn the respect of your peers and managers. This makes your job more enjoyable and should also be useful when it comes time to move on. A company that allows references will incentives employees to treat each-other well.</li>
<li>Expectation Driven Hours: There are two basic types of pay structures: Hourly and salary. Hourly is straight forward from a pay/compensation perspective. Salary, on the other hand, is slippery. The pay is constant which means the more hours one works, the less $/hour one gets paid. So how many hours should someone work when on a salary? The answer is, there is no answer. On a salary, an employee should be presented with expectations. Meeting those expectations defines their job. If they can meet those expectations while only spending 30 hours a week (an extreme case) they are just as useful to the company as someone meeting them while spending 60 hours a week. The point being, one cannot be told "work N hours per week" while on a salary but they can be told "do these N things".</li>
<li>Transfers are Driven by an Employee: If and when an employee is interested in switching teams within a company, the process should resemble that of switching jobs. If the employee and new manager decide they have mutual interest, that's that. The old manager is entitled to their opinion on the matter if solicited by the new manger, but otherwise, they probably shouldn't be involved.</li>
<li>Performance Quality is Based on Manager and Peer Review: Perhaps it is with good intentions that companies try to dream up objective measures of performance, but unless your job is quite literally turning a crank (in which case, number of turns per minute could reasonably be used) such performance measures will always come up flawed. In a complex work setting, performance can mean many different things at many different times. Good performance is a "you will know it when you see it" quantity and requires a subjective scrutiny on the part of individuals.</li>
<li>Employee Difficulties Handled Well: Sometimes employees struggle. Sometimes this means they will have to be asked to leave, other times the struggle is simply a rough patch. Each case is unique and should be dealt with sensitively and on a personal level between manager and managed.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are, many others I could put on a list like this, but this post is already dragging on.</p>
