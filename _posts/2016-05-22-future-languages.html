<p>I am quickly becoming proficient in a large number of programming languages, but alas I am not sated. Here is a short list of languages I think I want to learn better and roughly why.</p>

<h2><a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a></h2>

<p>
  Clojure is a dialect of lisp which runs on the JVM, .NET framwork, or transpiles to javascript. I become exposed to lisp while <a href="/projects/yasnippetBacksolve">building emacs extensions</a> in the so called ELisp language. Lisp has a beautifully clean and unified syntax and is a functional language. I would like to spend more time working in the JVM, but java (a language I alread know) is very similar to C# (another language I know) and I would like some variety. Clojure seems just the thing.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK">AWK</a></h2>
<p>
  AWK is a scripting language centered around processing text files and reporting. I like writing bash scripts where I regularly exploit grep and sed to their fullest. For some reason, however, I have under utilized AWK. Recently, however, I have started writing more complicated scripts to perform tasks which become clumsy and even slow in bash. In these cases, I need a stronger scripting language. So, why AWK? The reason is ubiquity. AWK comes hand in hand with linux whereas most other scripting languages (Ruby, Python, Emacs, ...) require a separate install. AWK is a pragmatic choice and besides this, it has a pretty slick syntax that comes naturally to me.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a></h2>
<p>
Out of all the languages on this list, I know the least R. I have tinkered with it and done quite a bit of reading about it's capabilities and would like to dig deeper. For statistical computations in the past, I have used MATLAB. But MATLAB is proprietary, R is open source. Need I say more?
