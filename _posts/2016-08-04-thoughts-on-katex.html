<p>As a mathist, I require the ability to render equations. Like most folks affected with a mathematical background, TEX/Latex is unavoidable. In talking with some friends, I heard about <a href="https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX">Katex</a>, a client side latex rendering package, and decided to figure out how to integrate it into my Jekyll posts.</p>

<p>After downloading Katex, the "README.md" reveled CDN for the .js and .css required for Katex. Thus my approach to enabling Katex was to put these into my "_includes/head.html" file:</p>

{% highlight html %}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.5.1/katex.min.css">
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.5.1/katex.min.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Further reading of the README.md reviels that Katex includes some javascript that will auto render any latex discovered in a given page. I opted not to use this script as I desired finer control (although I willingly admit my approach may not be the best).</p>

<p>In my posts, I created a class "latex" which I assigned to various "div" and "span" elements throughout my posts. Inside these elements, I wrote my raw latex. Thus my post looks like:</p>

{% highlight html %}
<p>An inline equation for a circle is <span class="latex">x^2 + y^2 = 1</span>. An equation for a hyperbola is:</p>

<div class="latex">
  x^2 - y^2 = 1
</div>

<p>bla bla bla blee bla bloosh.</p>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Finally, at the end of the post I included the simple JavaScript:</p>

{% highlight html %}
<script>
var kList = document.getElementsByClassName("latex");
for (var i = 0; i < kList.length; i++)
{
    var str = kList[i].textContent || kList[i].innerText || "";
    kList[i].innerHTML = "";
    katex.render(str, kList[i]);
}
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This approach also allows me to style equations in a more ganular way. For example if I want a dashed box around my "div" equations, I could add the style:</p>

{% highlight html %}
<style>
  div.latex {
    border: 1px dashed black;
    padding: 10px;
  }
</style>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Thinking that I would rather not explicitly paste JavaScript at the bottom of my blog posts, I'll most likely create a layout which handles these details. I have not done this yet. <a href="{% post_url 2016-08-02-AVL-Tree-Balancing %}">Here is an example</a> of a  post where I employ the above technique.</p>
