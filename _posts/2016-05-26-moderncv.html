<p>It's true. I am hopelessly addicted to latex (the mark up language, not the polymers). Latex is frustrating for the regular user. Even though I have used it extensively for research papers, note taking and presentations, I still consider myself a regular user. I have never plumbed the depth of Latex source code and customization options. Fanatics enthusiastically inform me that those depths are quite depthy, but sadly I don't care that Latex is a Turing complete language. I just want to make documents. I just want that image I included to A.) appear and B.) move one inch to the left and Latex makes simple tasks such as these comically hard at times.</p>

<p>I can't stand WYSIWYG document creation. I want my content and layout/themes to be separate concepts to be adjusted independently. So why not do everything in HTML + CSS? The short answer is: Formuals. Latex is insanely good at formulas which makes it indispensable for writing research papers. This makes sense as it was developed by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">mathematician</a>.</p>

<p>So us math folks get hooked early. Having chosen the path of mathematics, we are broke and can't afford Microsoft Office, so we start trying to get Latex to do everything from slide shows to resumes. This brings me to the topic of this post.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/moderncv/">moderncv</a> is a Latex package that I came across while re-factoring my resume. It comes as part of TeX Live and is painless to use. To get my barings, I started with an example .tex. From there, it was fairly easy to transpose my content into moderncv's tool set. Overall, it is a clean and clear resume tool with a fare bit of malleability. One can even swap out the "CV style" to get several radically different resume layouts with zero additional work. All of the built in styles look great and as I experimented, I began to regret my Latex addiction a bit less.</p>

<p>A quick note in case you decide to try it out: You will want compile using "xelatex". I often default to compiling using "pdflatex" or "latex" which gives odd results. Also, if your curious what my resume ended up looking like, feel free to check it out <a href="/resume/">here abouts</a>.</p>
