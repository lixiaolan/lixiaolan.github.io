<p>This project was an effort to understand the internet by building my own HTTP server from scratch in C++. I utilized the C API for socket communication but otherwise wrote everything myself. The server is small, and light on features but a great learning tool. So far I have deployed <a href="/projects/recipeWebsite/">one website</a> using this server.</p>
