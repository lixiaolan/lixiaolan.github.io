<p>After building <a href="/projects/httpServer">my own HTTP server</a> I set out to launch a website on top of it. The site (which is actively being used) is a recipe managment app which <a href="http://katyedidskitchen.com/">can be found here</a>. The site was written as a "one page app" in JavaScript.</p>
