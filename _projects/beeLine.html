<p>Bee-Line is a Android puzzle game. During my final years of graduate school a few of us came together to create an Android game. What we came up with was "Bee-Line" which is based on an original pen and paper puzzle game of my own invention. We created a tested our product and even started a business entity, <a href="http://www.seventhharmonic.com/index.html">Seventh Harmonic LLC</a>. I could go on and on describing the details of this project, but the game speaks for itself. You can download it and give it a <a href="http://playbeeline.com/">try it here</a>.</p>

<p>I learned a lot about the android platform by creating Bee-Line. We started with an empty android project and wrote everything ourselves. We quite literally started out by figuring out how to draw a blue triangle in OpenGL and worked from there. In addition to learning the core host of Android development tools, we also learned OpenGL, Android NDK, and SQL within the Android framework. Every part of the project is original; a list which includes the puzzle, every line of code, the art on the screen, the music and even the company backing the product.</p>

<p>Even when we created Bee-Line, there were numerous 2D graphics engines for building games that we could have leveraged. In the interest of learning, however, we chose to do everything ourselves. In the end we created our own graphics engine tailored exactly to our needs which we intend to build off of in the future.</p>
