<p>Bee-Line is a Android puzzle game. During my final years of graduate school a few of us came together to create an Android game. What we came up with was "Bee-Line" which is based on an original pen and paper puzzle game of my own invention. We created a tested our product and even started a business entity, <a href="http://www.seventhharmonic.com/index.html">Seventh Harmonic LLC</a>. I could go on and on describing the details of this project, but the game speaks for itself. You can download it and give it a <a href="http://playbeeline.com/">try it here</a>.</p>

<p>I learned a lot about the android platform by creating Bee-Line. We started with an empty android project and wrote everything ourselves. We quite literally started out by figuring out how to draw a blue triangle in OpenGL and worked from there. The project involved learning OpenGL, Android NDK, Android SQL interfacing, and the host of android development tools. Every part of the project is original form the puzzle, every line of code, the art on the screen, the music and even the company backing the product.</p>

<p>As fun as it was to build everything ourselves, we would never take this approach again. Even when we created Bee-Line, there were numerous 2D graphics frameworks for building games that we could have leveraged. In the interest of learning, we chose to do everything ourselves. In future projects we would absolutely take advantage of available tools.</p>
